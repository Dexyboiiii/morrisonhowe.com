        <p> Crystal Turner-Brightman is a theatre maker, director, actress, poet, and activist. She trained at the
            University of Chichester, achieving a BA Hons in Theatre. <br> <br>

            She creates thought provoking theatre that challenges boundaries and educates its
            audience, infusing spoken word into performance. Crystal’s work has an emphasis on
            mental health, sexuality, gender, body image, society, and the environment. Previous work includes ‘Inside A
            Mind’, a story of a young girl coming to terms with the impacts of trauma. <br> <br>

            Crystal has worked both on and off stage, directing and performing in originally devised work, established
            plays, and established musicals. She is also a spoken-word poet and has performed at multiple poetry
            events. As well as this, she’s a passionate activist, creating and promoting her own campaigns. <br> <br>

            Crystal is also an experienced teacher, having previously worked at Theatretrain Southampton and at
            Razzamataz Theatre School Bognor Regis. In these roles, Crystal organised
            and wrote productions for her students to perform, as well as planning weekly lessons for them in the
            performing and creative arts.<br> <br>

            As an activist Crystal has supported a range of charities such as Southampton Stand
            Up To Racism, Stars Appeal B.U.G.S (Burns Unit Group Support), and Fixers UK. Crystal has personally been
            affected by PTSD after an accident left her with third degree burns. She is now a proud burns survivor and
            has spoken candidly about her experience. She is currently an Ambassador for Children’s Burns Trust.
